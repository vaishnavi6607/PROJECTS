            <p>My Halloween decorations are staying in the box this year. To be honest, they didn’t make it out of the
                box last year either. My Halloween spirit has officially been bludgeoned to death by teenagers who no

                isn’t there more than enough of that going around? Maybe all of us can pretend that Halloween isn’t even
                happening this year?</p><br>
